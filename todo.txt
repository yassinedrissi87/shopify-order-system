Error handling: The script should include more detailed error handling to provide more informative error messages to the user.

Use a logger: Instead of relying on printing messages to the console, the script should use a logging library to log errors, warnings, and other messages to a log file.

Documentation: The script could benefit from some documentation to explain what each part of the script does, and any prerequisites or assumptions.

Unit tests: The script could be enhanced with some unit tests to ensure its functionality.
